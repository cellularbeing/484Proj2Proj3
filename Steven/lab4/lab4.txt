Lab4 by Steven Blachowiak and Ivan Chacon

Lab4.zip contains:
- lab4.php
	> HTML document with the login and registration form. 
- lab4.css
	> CSS style sheet.
- insert.php
	> A PHP file that takes the users data from the registration form and inserts it into the database.
	> If a duplicate user exists the user will not be added.
- login.php
	> Checks the database for a matched user and then checks if the passwords match before "logging" them on.
	
The whole project is complete. A user can register with a new username and password. If they are in the database they can log on.

The extra credit is COMPLETED. The passwords (with salt appended) are stored in the database alongside the salt.

There are NO restrictions to what can be a password or user name. The only restriction is that the username must not already be in the database.
